## Releasing a New Version

### Versioning Stategy

Always create a new version of the docs for a major release.  Other than that, try to avoid creating new releases when nothing
much has changed.  We can make changes to old versions directly, if needed.

### How to create a new version

Review versioning docs on [Docusuaurus' site](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning).

1. Run this script to make sure you have the most up to date o1js artifacts (changelog and autogenerated documentation)

```sh
./scripts/update_o1js_artifacts.sh
```
2. Ensure that the value in `.o1js_version` reflects the name of the version you want to release
3. Run this script to create the new version

```sh
./scripts/cut_version.sh
```

### Testing

```sh
npm run test
```
