## Introduction

Welcome to this guide on HMAC-SHA256! Before diving into implementation, let's understand what HMAC is, why it's important, and how it works. This foundational knowledge will help you better understand the zero-knowledge implementation.

### What You'll Learn

- Implementing HMAC-SHA256 in a zero-knowledge circuit using o1js
- Working with provable arrays and bit manipulation in ZkPrograms
- Using cryptographic gadgets like SHA256 in o1js
- Applying metaprogramming patterns to shape circuit structure - using static control flow to shape circuit structure
- Best practices for writing complex zero-knowledge circuits

## What is HMAC?

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a specific type of message authentication code that combines:
- A cryptographic hash function
- A secret key

It provides a way to verify both:
- Data integrity (message hasn't been modified)
- Message authenticity (sender is verified)

:::info Historical Note
The HMAC construction was first published in 1996 by Mihir Bellare, Ran Canetti, and Hugo Krawczyk. It has since become a fundamental building block in standards like TLS, JWT, and many others.
:::

### Why Use HMAC?

1. **Message Integrity**: Ensures the message hasn't been tampered with
2. **Authentication**: Verifies the sender's identity through the shared secret key
3. **Non-repudiation**: The sender cannot deny sending the message (when combined with other cryptographic primitives)

### Why HMAC-SHA256 Specifically? 

HMAC-SHA256 uses SHA-256 as its underlying hash function. It's widely used because:
- SHA-256 is cryptographically secure
- The 256-bit output size provides strong security against collision attacks
- It's relatively fast to compute
- It's widely supported across different platforms and languages

## HMAC-SHA256: Under the Hood

### The Algorithm

The HMAC algorithm can be expressed as:

```
HMAC(k,m) = H((k_0 ^ opad) || H((k_0 ^ ipad) || m))
```

Where:
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| k | Secret key |
| m | Message to authenticate |
| H | Hash function (SHA-256) |
| k_0 | Derived key (padded/hashed key) |
| opad | Outer padding (0x5c repeated) |
| ipad | Inner padding (0x36 repeated) |
| \|\| | Concatenation |
| ^ | XOR operation |

:::note Block Size
Since we're using SHA-256 as our hash function, the block size is 64 bytes (512 bits). This is a property of SHA-256's internal block processing. The key `k` is processed into `k_0` based on its length:
- If key length < 64 bytes: Padded with zeros to 64 bytes
- If key length = 64 bytes: Used as-is without modification
- If key length > 64 bytes: Hashed using SHA-256 (producing 32 bytes) and then padded with zeros to 64 bytes
