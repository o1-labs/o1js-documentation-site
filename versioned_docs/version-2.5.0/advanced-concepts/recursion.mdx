Recursion is a powerful tool for solving complex problems with zk proofs.  Any particular constraint system will be limited by
the lack of dynamic programming and conditional execution, but these shortcomings can be mitigated at the system architecture
level with recursion.

## Fibonacci Example

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of recursion.  We can use recursive zk proofs to succinctly verify any element in
the sequence.

### Define the Fibonacci State Type

First thing's first, let's define a provable type to represent the state of a Fibonacci sequence.  We'll track the index of the
sequence, and the last two numbers in the sequence.  We'll use a `Struct` to represent the state, and we'll add some extra
functionality to the class that will be useful in the constraint system and tests.

```ts file=../snippets/recursion/recursion.ts start=start_fibonacci_state end=end_fibonacci_state
```

### Writing the Recursive Program

With the state data type defined, we can move on to writing a recursive program to prove execution of the Fibonacci sequence.
The program needs two methods: one to represent the base case, and one to represent the recursive case.  The two reasons for
which we need a base case are: 1. to generate a proof when we don't have a previous one to build off of, and 2. to prove that
all other proofs are built off of the same base case.


```ts file=../snippets/recursion/recursion.ts start=start_fibonacci_program end=end_fibonacci_program
```

For more details on `SelfProof`, check out the [api reference](/api-reference/classes/SelfProof.mdx).


### Using the Fibonacci Program

Now that we have a program, we can use it to generate proofs.  Here is some example code showing how to generate a proof and
interact with it recursively.

```ts file=../snippets/recursion/recursion.ts start=start_fibonacci_usage end=end_fibonacci_usage
```

## Queue Compression Example

For a more realistic example, let's say that we have an application with some queue of events to process, and we want to
provably process them in a batch.  In the example below, let's say we just want to compute the sum, but also prove that 
processed the entire queue.

### Fill a Queue with Data

In this example, the queue will look a little like a blockchain.  Each event will include a value and a hash of the value
and the previous event hash.  That way we can prove that we've processed the queue in order.

```ts file=../snippets/recursion/recursion.ts start=start_queue_data end=end_queue_data
```

### Write the Recursive Program

For the program, we need a data type like in the Fibonacci example.  In this case, we'll want to track the running sum,
the starting hash of the proof range, and the latest hash that has been processed.  Like in the Fibonacci
example, we'll need a base case and a recursive case.  The base case will be a sum of 0 and a hash of 0, and the
recursive case will add one value to the running sum and update the hashes.

```ts file=../snippets/recursion/recursion.ts start=start_queue_program end=end_queue_program
```

### Using the Queue Program

Here's how you would use the queue program to generate a proof.

```ts file=../snippets/recursion/recursion.ts start=start_queue_usage end=end_queue_usage
```
