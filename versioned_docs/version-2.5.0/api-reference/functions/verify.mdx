```ts
function verify(proof: 
  | ProofBase
| JsonProof, verificationKey: string | VerificationKey): Promise<boolean>
```

Defined in: [lib/proof-system/zkprogram.ts:108](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/df1ff77af12d7cbbed4a6167f02815fad4f0dceb/src/lib/proof-system/zkprogram.ts#L108)

Initializes Pickles bindings, serializes the input proof and verification key for use in OCaml, then calls into the Pickles verify function and returns the result.

## Parameters

### proof

Either a `Proof` instance or a serialized JSON proof

[`ProofBase`](../classes/ProofBase.mdx) | [`JsonProof`](../type-aliases/JsonProof.mdx)

### verificationKey

Either a base64 serialized verification key or a `VerificationKey` instance which will be base64 serialized for use in the bindings.

`string` | [`VerificationKey`](../classes/VerificationKey.mdx)

## Returns

`Promise`\<`boolean`\>

A promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the proof is valid.
