Defined in: [lib/provable/types/provable-intf.ts:114](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/df1ff77af12d7cbbed4a6167f02815fad4f0dceb/src/lib/provable/types/provable-intf.ts#L114)

`ProvablePure<T>` is a special kind of [Provable](Provable.mdx) interface, where the "auxiliary" (non-provable) data is empty.
This means the type consists only of field elements, in that sense it is "pure".
Any instance of `ProvablePure<T>` is also an instance of `Provable<T>` where the "auxiliary" data is empty.

Examples where `ProvablePure<T>` is required are types of on-chain state, events and actions.
