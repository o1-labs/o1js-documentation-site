## Type Aliases

| Type alias | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [ActionStates](type-aliases/ActionStates.mdx) | - |
| [FeePayerSpec](type-aliases/FeePayerSpec.mdx) | Allows you to specify information about the fee payer account and the transaction. |
| [IncludedTransaction](type-aliases/IncludedTransaction.mdx) | Represents a transaction that has been successfully included in a block. |
| [NetworkConstants](type-aliases/NetworkConstants.mdx) | - |
| [PendingTransaction](type-aliases/PendingTransaction.mdx) | Represents a transaction that has been submitted to the blockchain but has not yet reached a final state. The [PendingTransaction](type-aliases/PendingTransaction.mdx) type extends certain functionalities from the base [Transaction](type-aliases/Transaction.mdx) type, adding methods to monitor the transaction's progress towards being finalized (either included in a block or rejected). |
| [PendingTransactionPromise](type-aliases/PendingTransactionPromise.mdx) | A `Promise<PendingTransaction>` with an additional `wait` method, which calls into the inner `TransactionStatus`'s `wait` method upon its resolution. |
| [PendingTransactionStatus](type-aliases/PendingTransactionStatus.mdx) | - |
| [RejectedTransaction](type-aliases/RejectedTransaction.mdx) | Represents a transaction that has been rejected and not included in a blockchain block. |
| [TestPublicKey](type-aliases/TestPublicKey.mdx) | - |
| [Transaction](type-aliases/Transaction.mdx) | Defines the structure and operations associated with a transaction. This type encompasses methods for serializing the transaction, signing it, generating proofs, and submitting it to the network. |
