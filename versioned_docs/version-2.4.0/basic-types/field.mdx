## Field
Field elements are the basic unit of data in zero knowledge proof programming.  An element of a Field is like an integer, except that all operations
are performed modulo a prime.  Each field element can store a number up to almost 256 bits in size.  All other data types that can be used in 
provable code can be represented as Fields.

:::note

For the cryptography inclined, the exact max value that a field can store is: {BigInt(constants.max_size).toLocaleString()}.

:::

For example, in typical programming, you might use:

`const sum = 1 + 3;`.

In o1js, you write this as:

```ts file=../snippets/field/field.ts start=start_sum_1 end=end_sum_1
```

This can be simplified as:

```ts file=../snippets/field/field.ts start=start_sum_2 end=end_sum_2
```

### Overflow Behavior

Field arithmetic supports overflow and underflow.  See [Integers](/docs/basic-types/int.mdx) for an o1js type that behaves more like a traditional integer type.

```ts file=../snippets/field/field.ts start=start_overflow end=end_overflow
```

```ts file=../snippets/field/field.ts start=start_underflow end=end_underflow
```
