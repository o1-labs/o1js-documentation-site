## Introduction

Welcome to this walkthrough of implementing HMAC-SHA256 in o1js! This tutorial will guide you through creating a zero-knowledge circuit (ZkProgram) that implements the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, a widely used cryptographic hash-based message authentication code.

### What You'll Learn

- Implementing HMAC-SHA256 in a zero-knowledge circuit using o1js

## Understanding HMAC

### What is HMAC?

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a specific type of message authentication code that combines:
- A cryptographic hash function
- A secret key

It provides a way to verify both:
- Data integrity (message hasn't been modified)
- Message authenticity (sender is verified)

:::info Historical Note
The HMAC construction was first published in 1996 by Mihir Bellare, Ran Canetti, and Hugo Krawczyk. It has since become a fundamental building block in standards like TLS, JWT, and many others.
:::

### Why Use HMAC?

1. **Message Integrity**: Ensures the message hasn't been tampered with
2. **Authentication**: Verifies the sender's identity through the shared secret key
3. **Non-repudiation**: The sender cannot deny sending the message (when combined with other cryptographic primitives)

### Why HMAC-SHA256 Specifically? 

HMAC-SHA256 uses SHA-256 as its underlying hash function. It's widely used because:
- SHA-256 is cryptographically secure
- The 256-bit output size provides strong security against collision attacks
- It's relatively fast to compute
- It's widely supported across different platforms and languages


## HMAC-SHA256: Under the Hood

### The Algorithm

The HMAC algorithm can be expressed as:

```
HMAC(k,m) = H((k_0 ^ opad) || H((k_0 ^ ipad) || m))
```

Where:
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| k | Secret key |
| m | Message to authenticate |
| H | Hash function (SHA-256) |
| k_0 | Derived key (padded/hashed key) |
| opad | Outer padding (0x5c repeated) |
| ipad | Inner padding (0x36 repeated) |
| \|\| | Concatenation |
| ^ | XOR operation |

:::note Block Size
Since we're using SHA-256 as our hash function, the block size is 64 bytes (512 bits). This is a property of SHA-256's internal block processing. The key `k` is processed into `k_0` based on its length:
- If key length < 64 bytes: Padded with zeros to 64 bytes
- If key length = 64 bytes: Used as-is without modification
- If key length > 64 bytes: Hashed using SHA-256 (producing 32 bytes) and then padded with zeros to 64 bytes

### The Process Step by Step

1. **Key Preparation** üîë
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[Input Key] --> B{Key Length?}
   B -->|> 64 bytes| C[Hash Key] --> D[Pad with Zeros] --> E[k_0]
   B -->|= 64 bytes| E
   B -->|< 64 bytes| D
   ```

2. **Inner Hash** üîÑ
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[k_0] --> B[XOR with ipad]
   B --> C[Concatenate Message]
   C --> D[SHA-256]
   ```

3. **Outer Hash** üîÑ
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[k_0] --> B[XOR with opad]
   B --> C[Concatenate Inner Hash]
   C --> D[SHA-256]
   ```
