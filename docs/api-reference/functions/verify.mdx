```ts
function verify(proof: 
  | ProofBase<any, any>
| JsonProof, verificationKey: string | VerificationKey): Promise<boolean>;
```

Defined in: [lib/proof-system/zkprogram.ts:110](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/fca908c243ee8e908efacaf73a882d48759e675a/src/lib/proof-system/zkprogram.ts#L110)

Initializes Pickles bindings, serializes the input proof and verification key for use in OCaml, then calls into the Pickles verify function and returns the result.

## Parameters

### proof

Either a `Proof` instance or a serialized JSON proof

[`ProofBase`](../classes/ProofBase.mdx)\<`any`, `any`\> | [`JsonProof`](../type-aliases/JsonProof.mdx)

### verificationKey

Either a base64 serialized verification key or a `VerificationKey` instance which will be base64 serialized for use in the bindings.

`string` | [`VerificationKey`](../classes/VerificationKey.mdx)

## Returns

`Promise`\<`boolean`\>

A promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the proof is valid.

## Note

This function is meant to be called in JavaScript, not for use in a circuit.  The verification key data and hash are not confirmed to match.
