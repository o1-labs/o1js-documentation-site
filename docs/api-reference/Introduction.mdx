# o1js &nbsp; [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/o1js.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/o1js) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/o1js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/o1js) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

ℹ️ **o1js** is an evolution of
[SnarkyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkyjs) which saw 49 updated versions
over two years of development with 43,141 downloads.

This name change to o1js reflects the evolution of our vision for the premiere
toolkit used by developers to build zero knowledge-enabled applications, while
paying homage to our technology's recursive proof generation capabilities.

Your favorite functionality stays the same and transitioning to o1js is a quick
and easy process:

- To update zkApp-cli, run the following command:

  `npm i -g zkapp-cli@latest`

- To remove the now-deprecated SnarkyJS package and install o1js, run the
  following command:

  `npm remove snarkyjs && npm install o1js`

- For existing zkApps, make sure to update your imports from `snarkyjs` to
  `o1js`
- No need to redeploy, you are good to go!

## o1js

o1js helps developers build apps powered by zero knowledge (zk) cryptography.

The easiest way to write zk programs is using o1js.

o1js is a TypeScript library for
[zk-SNARKs](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/what-are-zk-snarks) and zkApps. You
can use o1js to write zk smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the
Mina Protocol.

o1js is automatically included when you create a project using the
[zkApp CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkapp-cli).

## Learn More

- To learn more about developing zkApps, see the

If the side loaded proofs and verification keys do not match the specified feature flag configurations, the verification will fail. Flags specified as `undefined` are considered as `maybe` by Pickles. This means, proofs can be sided loaded that can, but don't have to, use a specific custom gate. _Note:_ `Maybe` feature flags incur a proving overhead. |
| [Field](variables/Field.mdx) | A [Field](variables/Field.mdx) is an element of a prime order [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field). Every other provable type is built using the [Field](variables/Field.mdx) type. |

| [createForeignField](functions/createForeignField.mdx) | Create a class representing a prime order finite field, which is different from the native [Field](classes/Field.mdx). |
| [declareMethods](functions/declareMethods.mdx) | `declareMethods` can be used in place of the `@method` decorator to declare SmartContract methods along with their list of arguments. It should be placed _after_ the class declaration. Here is an example of declaring a method `update`, which takes a single argument of type `Field`: `class MyContract extends SmartContract { // ... update(x: Field) { // ... } } declareMethods(MyContract, { update: [Field] }); // `[Field]` is the list of arguments!` Note that a method of the same name must still be defined on the class, just without the decorator. |
| [declareState](functions/declareState.mdx) | `declareState` can be used in place of the `@state` decorator to declare on-chain state on a SmartContract. It should be placed _after_ the class declaration. Here is an example of declaring a state property `x` of type `Field`. `class MyContract extends SmartContract { x = State<Field>(); // ... } declareState(MyContract, { x: Field });` |
| [DynamicArray](functions/DynamicArray.mdx) | Dynamic-length array type that has a - constant maximum capacity, but - dynamic actual length |
| [fetchAccount](functions/fetchAccount.mdx) | Gets account information on the specified publicKey by performing a GraphQL query to the specified endpoint. This will call the 'GetAccountInfo' query which fetches zkapp related account information. |

| [fetchLastBlock](functions/fetchLastBlock.mdx) | Fetches the last block on the Mina network. |

| [memoizeWitness](functions/memoizeWitness.mdx) | Like Provable.witness, but memoizes the witness during transaction construction for reuse by the prover. This is needed to witness non-deterministic values. |
| [MerkleListBase](functions/MerkleListBase.mdx) | - |
| [merkleListHash](functions/merkleListHash.mdx) | - |
| [MerkleWitness](functions/MerkleWitness.mdx) | Returns a circuit-compatible Witness for a specific Tree height. |

| [setGraphqlEndpoints](functions/setGraphqlEndpoints.mdx) | - |
| [setNumberOfWorkers](functions/setNumberOfWorkers.mdx) | Set the number of workers to use for parallelizing the proof generation. By default the number of workers is set to the number of physical CPU cores on your machine, but there may be some instances where you want to set the number of workers manually. Some machines may have a large number of cores, but not enough memory to support that many workers. In that case, you can set the number of workers to a lower number to avoid running out of memory. On the other hand, some machines with heterogeneous cores may benefit from setting the number of workers to a lower number to avoid contention between core types if load-link/store-conditional multithreading is used. Feel free to experiment and see what works best for your use case. Maybe you can squeeze slightly more performance out by tweaking this value :) |
| [state](functions/state.mdx) | A decorator to use within a zkapp to indicate what will be stored on-chain. For example, if you want to store a field element `some_state` in a zkapp, you can use the following in the declaration of your zkapp: |
| [State](functions/State-1.mdx) | - |
| [Struct](functions/Struct.mdx) | `Struct` lets you declare composite types for use in o1js circuits. |
