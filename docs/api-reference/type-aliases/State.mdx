Gettable and settable state that can be checked for equality.

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **A**

## Type declaration

### fetch()

Asynchronously fetch the on-chain state. This is intended for getting the state outside a smart contract.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `A`\>

### fromAppState()

Get the state from the raw list of field elements on a zkApp account, for example:

```ts
let myContract = new MyContract(address);
let account = Mina.getAccount(address);

let x = myContract.x.fromAppState(account.zkapp!.appState);
```

#### Parameters

##### appState

[`Field`](../classes/Field.mdx)[]

#### Returns

`A`

### get()

Get the current on-chain state.

Caution: If you use this method alone inside a smart contract, it does not prove that your contract uses the current on-chain state.
To successfully prove that your contract uses the current on-chain state, you must add an additional `.requireEquals()` statement or use `.getAndRequireEquals()`:

```ts
let x = this.x.get();
this.x.requireEquals(x);
```

OR

```ts
let x = this.x.getAndRequireEquals();
```

#### Returns

`A`

### getAndRequireEquals()

Get the current on-chain state and prove it really has to equal the on-chain state,
by adding a precondition which the verifying Mina node will check before accepting this transaction.

#### Returns

`A`

### requireEquals()

Prove that the on-chain state has to equal the given state,
by adding a precondition which the verifying Mina node will check before accepting this transaction.

#### Parameters

##### a

`A`

#### Returns

`void`

### requireEqualsIf()

Require that the on-chain state has to equal the given state if the provided condition is true.

If the condition is false, this is a no-op.
If the condition is true, this adds a precondition that the verifying Mina node will check before accepting this transaction.

#### Parameters

##### condition

[`Bool`](../classes/Bool.mdx)

##### a

`A`

#### Returns

`void`

### requireNothing()

**DANGER ZONE**: Override the error message that warns you when you use `.get()` without adding a precondition.

#### Returns

`void`

### set()

Set the on-chain state to a new value.

#### Parameters

##### a

`A`

#### Returns

`void`
