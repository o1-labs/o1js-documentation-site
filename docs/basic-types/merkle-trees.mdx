title: Merkle Trees
---

Merkle trees are a fundamental data structure for collections in o1js, as they allow for effecient proofs of data inclusion.
There are several classes of Merkle tree exported by o1js, with various properties.

## IndexedMerkleMap

The `IndexedMerkleMap` is a wrapper around a basic [Merkle tree](/basic-types/merkle-trees.mdx#MerkleTree) that offers a convenient
interface, with a key-value like API for getting and setting values.

Both the key and the value in of the map can be typed as `Field` or `BigInt`.  

:::note
`IndexedMerkleMap` has a maximum height of 52, which means it can store up to 2^52 (roughly four quadrillion) elements.  Therefore, it is not suitable for
use cases requiring collision resistance over a larger domain, but it is suitable for most applications.  For instance, an app with billions of users
could have a leaf for each user stored in an `IndexedMerkleMap`.

## MerkleTree

The `MerkleTree` class is a general sparse Merkle tree implementation in JavaScript (not provable).  It is used to build and store
data in a tree structure, and exposes methods for generating witnesses and roots to use within provable code.

### MerkleWitness

The `MerkleWitness` class is a proof of inclusion for a specific leaf in a `MerkleTree`.  The `MerkleWitness` class _is_ provable, so
it can be used as an input into a provable function.  The witness consists of the leaf index and the hashes of sibling nodes, needed
to generate the root hash of the tree.

```ts file=../../snippets/merkle-trees/merkle-trees.ts start=start_merkle_tree end=end_merkle_tree
```

## MerkleList

The `MerkleList` is a class which represents a dynamic list of elements that can be committed to a single hash.  This is a useful
data structure when editing a list is required within a proof.  To pass a list into a proof as an argument, a 
[provable array](/docs/basic-types/arrays.mdx) may be simpler.

```ts file=../../snippets/merkle-trees/merkle-trees.ts start=start_merkle_list end=end_merkle_list
```
