title: Arrays
---

Arrays in provable code must be of a fixed size.  Normal JavaScript arrays are a suitable value to pass into a provable function, but
`Array<T>` is not a suitable type.  o1js exports the `Provable.Array` helper to generate provable array classes.

```ts file=../../snippets/arrays/arrays.ts start=start_provable_array end=end_provable_array
```

JavaScript arrays will satisfy the provable array type as long as they are of the correct size, so you don't need to worry too much about
casting them back and forth.

```ts file=../../snippets/arrays/arrays.ts start=start_in_witness end=end_in_witness
```
