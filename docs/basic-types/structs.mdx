title: Structs
---

Putting together all of the basic types covered in the preceding sections, we can use `Struct` to create more complex provable types.
`Struct` is a generic function that takes a configuration of properties and types that returns a class with the same properties and types.
The struct is always provable, but the types in the configuration must also be provable.
