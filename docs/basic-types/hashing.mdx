### Poseidon
[Poseidon](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/poseidon.html) is the most efficient hashing algorithm for o1js, and it should be 
used for general purpose hashing.  It operates over Field arrays, and all provable types can be converted to Field arrays.

```ts file=../../snippets/hashing/hashing.ts start=start_poseidon end=end_poseidon
```

### Other Hash Functions
Other hash functions are supported, but should be reserved for cases where a specific hash function is required.  For example,
proving verification of an ethereum hash would involve calculating a keccak hash.  In general, these other hash functions operate
over blocks of bytes of a specific size (like 32 bytes).

```ts file=../../snippets/hashing/hashing.ts start=start_other_hashes end=end_other_hashes
```
