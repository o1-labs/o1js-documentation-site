[Poseidon](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/poseidon.html) is the most effecient hashing algorithm for o1js, and it should be used for general purpose hashing.

Other hash functions are supported, but should be reserved for cases where a specific hash function is required.  For example,
proving verification of an ethereum hash would involve calculating a keccak hash.
