# Introduction to zkApps

zkApps are smart contracts that run on the Mina blockchain, powered by zero-knowledge proofs. Unlike traditional smart contracts that execute on-chain, zkApps use an off-chain execution model where computation happens locally and only a proof of correct execution is submitted to the blockchain.

## What makes zkApps unique?

- **Off-chain execution**: Smart contract logic runs on the client, not on validators
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Only cryptographic proofs are submitted to the blockchain  
- **Privacy-preserving**: Sensitive data can remain private while still being verified
- **Scalable**: Complex computations don't burden the network
- **TypeScript-based**: Written in familiar TypeScript using o1js

## Basic zkApp Structure

Every zkApp is built using the `SmartContract` class from o1js:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/intro/intro.ts start=start_basic_zkapp end=end_basic_zkapp
```

## Key Concepts

- **State Management**: Store state on-chain using the `@state` decorator
- **Methods**: Public methods marked with `@method` generate proofs when called
- **Proofs**: Zero-knowledge proofs validate execution and are submitted to blockchain
- **Permissions**: Control who can update state, emit events, and modify contracts
