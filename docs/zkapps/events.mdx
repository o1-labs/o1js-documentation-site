# Events

Events are Field arrays that are emitted by zkApp methods and stored on an archive node. They provide an off-chain log of contract activity that can be used for indexing, user interfaces, and tracking app state changes.

## Basic Events

Define and emit events from your zkApp methods:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/events/events.ts start=start_basic_events end=end_basic_events
```

## Event Structure

Events are arrays of Fields and can be structured for different use cases:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/events/events.ts start=start_structured_events end=end_structured_events
```

Events are useful for creating audit trails, enabling off-chain indexing, and providing data for user interfaces.

## Fetching Events

Use `fetchEvents` to retrieve previously emitted events from an archive node:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/events/events.ts start=start_fetch_events end=end_fetch_events
```
