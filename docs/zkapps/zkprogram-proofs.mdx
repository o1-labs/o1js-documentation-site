# ZkProgram Proofs as Inputs

ZkProgram proofs can be used as inputs to zkApp methods, enabling powerful composition patterns. This allows you to verify complex computations off-chain and use the verified results in your smart contracts.

## Basic ZkProgram Integration

Define a ZkProgram and use its proofs in a smart contract:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/zkprogram-inputs/zkprogram-inputs.ts start=start_basic_zkprogram end=end_basic_zkprogram
```

## Recursive Proofs

Build recursive computations using self-referencing proofs:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/zkprogram-inputs/zkprogram-inputs.ts start=start_recursive_proofs end=end_recursive_proofs
```

This enables scalable computation, state transitions, and proof compression for arbitrary-length computations.
