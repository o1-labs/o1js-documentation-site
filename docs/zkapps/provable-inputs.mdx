# Provable Inputs

zkApp methods can accept various o1js types as parameters, enabling rich data handling while maintaining zero-knowledge properties. Understanding how to use provable inputs effectively is key to building sophisticated zkApps.

## Basic Provable Types

The fundamental o1js types can be used as method parameters:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/provable-inputs/provable-inputs.ts start=start_basic_provable_inputs end=end_basic_provable_inputs
```

Core types include `Field`, `Bool`, `UInt32`/`UInt64`, `PublicKey`, and `Signature`.

## Custom Struct Inputs

Create complex data structures using `Struct`:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/provable-inputs/provable-inputs.ts start=start_struct_inputs end=end_struct_inputs
```

Structs provide type safety, reusability, validation, and automatic serialization.
