# Local Development

LocalBlockchain provides a local testing environment for ZkApp development. Unlike live networks, LocalBlockchain runs entirely in-memory with pre-funded test accounts and configurable settings for rapid development and testing.

LocalBlockchain is essential for unit testing, integration testing, and development workflows. It provides instant transaction finality, deterministic behavior, and the ability to control proof generation for different testing scenarios.

## Basic Setup

Configure LocalBlockchain for your development environment:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/local-development/local-development.ts start=start_basic_setup end=end_basic_setup
```

## Configuration Options

LocalBlockchain accepts configuration parameters to control its behavior:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/local-development/local-development.ts start=start_configuration_options end=end_configuration_options
```

## Test Accounts

LocalBlockchain provides 10 pre-funded test accounts:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/local-development/local-development.ts start=start_test_accounts end=end_test_accounts
```

## Deploying and Testing ZkApps

Here's a complete example showing how to define, deploy, and test a ZkApp on LocalBlockchain:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/local-development/local-development.ts start=start_deploy_and_test end=end_deploy_and_test
```

This example demonstrates the typical LocalBlockchain development workflow: define contracts, deploy to local environment, execute methods, and verify state changes.
