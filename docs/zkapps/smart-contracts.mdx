# SmartContract Basics

The `SmartContract` class is the foundation for building zkApps. It provides the framework for defining state, methods, and behavior of your zero-knowledge smart contracts.

## Basic Structure

Every zkApp extends the `SmartContract` class and follows this basic pattern:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/basic-smart-contract/basic-smart-contract.ts start=start_basic_contract end=end_basic_contract
```

Key components include state variables declared with `@state(Type)`, an `init()` method for setup, and public methods marked with `@method`.

## State Management

zkApps can have multiple state variables of different types:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/basic-smart-contract/basic-smart-contract.ts start=start_multiple_state end=end_multiple_state
```

State operations include `get()`, `getAndRequireEquals()`, `set()`, and `requireEquals()`.
