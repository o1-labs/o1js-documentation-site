# Deployment Guide

Deployment works the same way for ZkApps on Mina, Devnet, and Zeko.  All Smart Contracts have a `deploy()` method that must be called to create the account on chain.  The example code below shows an example of how to properly configure a Mina network and generate a deploy transaction.

Deploying a ZkApp on Mina implies creating a brand new account on chain.  That means that you need to generate a private key for the account, and pay an account creation fee, just like any other account.  The private key that you generate will have some default permissions (review the [Permissions](/docs/zkapps/permissions.mdx) documentation for a refresher).  Any permissions that are controlled by a signature will be possible to control by the private key holder of the Smart Contract.  However, if you deploy a Smart Contract with proof permissions for every operation, then the private key will not be able to perform those operations.  

:::warning
Currently, the only exception is the `setVerificationKey` permission, which can only be set to `impossibleDuringCurrentVersion()`, because in the event of a proof system upgrade to the entire chain, a smart contract will not be able to produce valid proofs until it is upgraded to the new proof system.

## Network Configuration

Configure your deployment target with the appropriate network:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/deployment/deployment.ts start=start_network_configs end=end_network_configs
```

## Deploying a ZkApp

Here's how to deploy a zkApp to any network:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/deployment/deployment.ts start=start_devnet_deployment end=end_devnet_deployment
```


## Network Comparison

| Network | Purpose | Tokens | Transaction Inclusion |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| Mainnet | Production L1 | Real MINA | ~3-5 min |
| Devnet | Testing L1 | Test MINA | ~5-10 min |
| Zeko Testnet | Testing L2 | Test MINA | ~10 sec |
