# Permissions System

zkApps use a sophisticated permissions system to control who can perform various operations on the smart contract. This system provides fine-grained access control for different aspects of your zkApp's behavior.

## Permission Types

zkApps support several permission types:

- **`Permissions.none()`**: No authorization required (use with caution)
- **`Permissions.impossible()`**: Operation cannot be performed by anyone
- **`Permissions.proof()`**: Requires a valid zero-knowledge proof
- **`Permissions.signature()`**: Requires a cryptographic signature
- **`Permissions.proofOrSignature()`**: Either proof or signature is acceptable
- **`Permissions.VerificationKey.impossibleDuringCurrentVersion()`**: Cannot be changed during the current protocol version, and signature after an upgrade
- **`Permissions.VerificationKey.proofDuringCurrentVersion()`**: Can be changed with a proof during the current protocol version, and signature after an upgrade

## Basic Permission Setup

Set permissions during contract initialization:

```ts file=../snippets/zkapps/permissions/permissions.ts start=start_basic_permissions end=end_basic_permissions
```
