title: What is a ZK Constraint System?
---

import codeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

In order to write effective o1js, you need to understand at least the basics of ZK constraint
systems. If you're coming from a background in web2 or web3, you should try to get a sense
for the fundamental differences between zk programming and programming for a VM before
getting deep into working with o1js. If you're coming from a background writing circuits
with other DSLs, then this article may be just a refresher!

You can think of a constraint system as an array of gates. Each gate is a simple math problem
that the prover knows how to verifiably compute that accepts some coefficients as input and
passes along some output to the next gate. As a mental model, you can think of gates in a
proof system like instructions on a CPU. A constraint system, then, is like a program that
is composed of a list of instructions to execute in order.

Don't take the metaphor too far! Proof systems don't operate over binary data like a CPU does,
and they don't have an analogous gate to `JUMP` or `GOTO`, which means that conditional
execution is not supported.

TODO: We could use an illustration here too

Currently, o1js is compatible with the Kimchi proof backend, which is specified in the
[Mina Book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html).

## Implications for Developers

There are two important implications that effect almost every ZK developer. Before getting
into code examples, you should be thinking about how this programming paradigm will change
the way you think about your code.

### No Dynamic Programming

When writing o1js, a common pattern is to "compile" a constraint system, then generate a proof
with the compiled artifact. We call the time while the constraint system is being built for
the first time "compile time", and the time when the proof is being generated against that
artifact "prover time".

At compile time, and at prover time, the constraint system needs to be identical. So if you
consider a common tool in programming, a dynamic loop, it won't work in ZK. When you compile
the circuit, a dummy value will be used for the variables, and it will follow some execution
path. Then all subsequent calls to the function must follow _exactly_ the same path. That
means different values of a variable can't result in different numbers of iterations over a
loop.

There are workarounds for this. For instance, you can write constraint systems that execute
a single step, and call the prover function a dynamic number of times. Or you can execute a
loop a fixed number of times, but with some dummy behavior. Consider this normal Javascript
code:

```ts
function multiplyAll(arr: number[]) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    result *= arr[i];
  }
  return result;
}
```

The function isn't "ZK friendly" because the number of iterations over the loop is dynamic.
To re-imagine this function for ZK, we can fix the size of the array, and fill the rest of
the array with ones, which will not affect the result of the multiplication:

```ts
function multiplyAll(arr: number[]) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    result *= arr[i] || 1;
  }
  return result;
}
```

This way, the function will always iterate 10 times, and for any input of less than or equal
to ten elements, the result will be the same. Note that for arrays larger than ten, the
result will _not_ be the same. You must carefully write your constraint systems to be
compatible with your domain.

### No Conditional Execution

Along the same lines, a function can't execute a different code path based on the value of a
variable. There are ways to conditionally assign values to variables (see:
[Conditional Logic](/docs/writing-constraint-systems/conditional-logic.mdx)), but the
execution path must always be identical.

### Rule of Thumb: Prove the Smallest Thing

A programming language with no dynamic programming and no conditional execution may sound
useless at first, but you don't need to write your entire application in ZK. ZK is a spice
that you can use sparingly to supercharge your application. When you specifically need to
prove something for privacy, scale, or security, you can write a constraint system to
model the problem you want to solve. What's amazing about o1js is that you can expose that
constraint system system directly to users in a browser, or to a service that can access
node. Design apps that use constraint systems with as little scope as possible to maximize
performance and developer experience.
