title: What is a ZK Constraint System?
---

import codeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

In order to write effective o1js, you need to understand at least the basics of ZK constraint
systems.  If you're coming from a background in web2 or web3, you should try to get a sense
for the fundamental differences between zk programming and programming in traditional compiled
and interpreted programming languages before getting deep into working with o1js.  If you're 
coming from a background writing circuits with other DSLs, then this article may be just a 
refresher!

You can think of a constraint system as an array of gates.  Each gate is a simple math problem
that the prover knows how to verifiably compute that accepts some coefficients as input and 
passes along some output to the next gate.  As a mental model, you can think of gates in a
proof system like instructions on a CPU.  A constraint system, then, is like a program that
is composed of a list of instructions to execute in order.

Don't take the metaphor too far!  Most proof systems don't operate over binary data like a 
CPU does, and they don't have an analogous gate to `JUMP` or `GOTO`, which means that
conditional execution is not supported.

TODO: We could use an illustration here too

Currently, o1js is compatible with the Kimchi proof backend (via a circuit-writing frontend 
called snarky), which is specified in the [Mina Book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html).

## Implications for Developers

There are two important implications that effect almost every ZK developer.  Before getting 
into code examples, you should be thinking about how this programming paradigm will change
the way you think about your code.

### No Dynamic Programming

When writing o1js, a common pattern is to "compile" a constraint system, then generate a proof
with the compiled artifact.  We call the time while the constraint system is being built for
the first time "compile time", and the time when the proof is being generated against that
artifact "prover time".  This process is similar to how a compiler works in a traditional
programming language.  The compiler takes a program, and generates an artifact in a more raw
form.  Traditionally, the compiler converts between a high level language that is human readable
and a low level language that is CPU readable.  In o1js, the compiler takes a high level
language and converts it to a constraint system that is executable by a prover or verifier.

At compile time, and at prover time, the constraint system needs to be identical.  So if you
consider a common tool in programming, a dynamic loop, it won't work in ZK.  When you compile
the circuit, a dummy value will be used for the variables, and it will follow some execution
path.  Then all subsequent calls to the function must follow _exactly_ the same path.  That
means different values of a variable can't result in different numbers of iterations over a
loop.

There are workarounds for this.  For instance, you can write constraint systems that execute 
a single step, and call the prover function a dynamic number of times.  Or you can execute a
loop a fixed number of times, but with some dummy behavior.  Consider this normal Javascript
code:

```ts
function multiplyAll(arr: number[]) {
    let result = 1;
    // This loop can be unbounded - At compile time, it will iterate 0 times, assuming we use a dummy value of [] for arr
    // At prover time, it will iterate arr.length times, resulting in a different constraint system, so the proof will not be valid
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        result *= arr[i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

The function isn't "ZK friendly" because the number of iterations over the loop is dynamic.
To re-imagine this function for ZK, we can fix the size of the array, and fill the rest of
the array with ones, which will not affect the result of the multiplication:

```ts
// NOTE: This is pseudo code, not valid o1js - proper provable code wraps all data in provable types
function multiplyAll(arr: number[]) {
    let result = 1;
    // This loop is fixed size - At compile time, it will iterate 10 times, regardless of the size of arr
    // At prover time, it will iterate 10 times, therefore the same constraint system will be generated, and the proof will be valid
    // NOTE: Again this is pseudo code, imagine that there is no index out of bounds error with arr[i]
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        result *= arr[i] || 1;
    }
    return result;
}
```

This way, the function will always iterate 10 times, and for any input of less than or equal
to ten elements, the result will be the same.  Note that for arrays larger than ten, the
result will _not_ be the same.  You must carefully write your constraint systems to be
compatible with your domain.

### No Conditional Execution

Along the same lines, a function can't execute a different code path based on the value of a
variable.  There are ways to conditionally assign values to variables (see: 
[Conditional Logic](/docs/writing-constraint-systems/conditional-logic.mdx)), but the
execution path must always be identical.

### Rule of Thumb: Prove the Smallest Thing

A programming language with no dynamic programming and no conditional execution may sound
useless at first, but you don't need to write your entire application in ZK.  ZK is a spice
that you can use sparingly to supercharge your application.  When you specifically need to
prove something for privacy, scale, or security, you can write a constraint system to 
model the problem you want to solve.  What's amazing about o1js is that you can expose that
constraint system system directly to users in a browser, or to a service that can access
node.  Design apps that use constraint systems with as little scope as possible to maximize
performance and developer experience.

The tradeoffs regarding dynamic programming and conditional execution can also be worked
around by writing small, well-scoped constraint systems.  Your JavaScript code can make
use of dynamic programming and compose simple proofs into more complex proofs.  Imagine
you are writing a sudoku solver.  A naÃ¯ve approach would be to model the entire solver
in o1js and make it provable.  But if you break the problem down, _solving_ the sudoku
doesn't need to be provable, only _verifying_ the solution does.  So you can write a
JavaScript solver that uses dynamic programming to solve the sudoku simply, and write an
o1js constraint system to verify the solution for any given input.  You can even write a 
constraint system that verifies the proof of a single solution, and adds the solution to 
a list of known solutions.  By writing simple constraint systems, that do one thing well,
you can compose more complex systems that prove interesting things.
