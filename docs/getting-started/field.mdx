## Field
Field elements are the basic unit of data in zero knowledge proof programming. Each field element can store a number up to almost 256 bits in size. You can think of a field element as a `uint256` in Solidity.

:::note

For the cryptography inclined, the exact max value that a field can store is: {max_size}

:::

For example, in typical programming, you might use:

`const sum = 1 + 3`.

In o1js, you write this as:

```ts file=../../snippets/field/sum.ts#L3
```

This can be simplified as:

```ts file=../../snippets/field/sum.ts#L5-L6
```
