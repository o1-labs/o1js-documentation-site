## Built-in Types

o1js has several built-in types on top of [Field](/docs/getting-started/field.mdx).  Each type can be converted to an array of Field elements.

### Integers

o1js exports a few different integer types:

- Unsigned integers: `UInt8`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`
- Signed integers: `Int64`

These types have range checks built in so that they will throw on overflow or underflow.
