title: Serialization
---

Proofs and verification keys can be serialized to disk for convenience and interoperability.  Compiled
constraint systems also have a cache protocol which can be used to speed up the time it takes to generate
and verify proofs.  In the following examples, pretend we have a dummy `ZkProgram` like so:

```ts file=../snippets/serialization/serialization.ts start=start_dummy end=end_dummy
```

## Serializing Proofs and Verification Keys

Proofs and verification keys in o1js are really representations of `Pickles` artifacts that are passed through
the bindings layer into OCaml.  In JavaScript, we only store base64 encoded strings, which can be easily
serialized to save for later use.

```ts file=../snippets/serialization/serialization.ts start=start_proofs_and_vks end=end_proofs_and_vks
```

## Using the Cache Protocol for ZkProgram and SmartContract

When calling `compile` on a `ZkProgram` or `SmartContract`, you can pass in a cache parameter.  The cache must
be an object that implements the Cache protocol.  o1js exports a file system cache implementation by default.
Here's an example of how to use it:

```ts file=../snippets/serialization/serialization.ts start=start_cache end=end_cache
```

Check out the [api reference](/api-reference/variables/Cache/) for more details.
