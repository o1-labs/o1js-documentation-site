title: Sideloaded Verification Keys
sidebar_label: Sideloading
---

In the article on [recursion](/docs/advanced-concepts/recursion.mdx), we showed how o1js can be used to
write constraint systems that verify other constraint systems.  Those examples always assumed that the
prover has compiled an instance of the other `ZkProgram`.  We can, in fact, go even more general than that.
With sideloading, we can verify any proof, given that its shape (public inputs and outputs) are known at
compile time, and the verification key is available at runtime.

The use cases for sideloading include:
- Upgradability: Without needing to recomplile the entire program (breaking compatibility with existing 
  proofs), you can write your program with sideloading from the start, to support future use cases.
- Flexibility: You can write programs that are compatible with several proofs without enumerating them
  individually.  (Remember that without conditional execution, it's not possible to write a big switch
  statement to handle different proof types.  So sideloading can be an effective way to streamline an
  app).

## Multiple Hash Example

Let's say we have an application with multiple hashing algorithms in use.  We want to write a simple Zk
Program to verify that a user knows the preimage of a hash, but we want to support any of our 
algorithms.  Let's solve this by writing a specific program for each algorithm, and a wrapper program
that verifies any of them.

### Setup

First, let's set up a Bytes32 class and some different hash function proofs.  Note that all proofs must
have the same shape.

```ts file=../snippets/sideloaded-vks/sideloaded-vks.ts start=start_multi_hash_setup end=end_multi_hash_setup
```

### Defining a Sideloaded Proof

Usually, a `ZkProgram`'s proof type is inferrable, but since we want to sideload one of several proofs, we
need to define the proof class explicitly.

```ts file=../snippets/sideloaded-vks/sideloaded-vks.ts start=start_multi_hash_proof end=end_multi_hash_proof
```

For more details on `DynamicProof` and `FeatureFlags`, check out the api reference: [DynamicProof](/api-reference/classes/DynamicProof.mdx), [FeatureFlags](/api-reference/variables/FeatureFlags.mdx).


### Using the Sideloaded Proof in a ZkProgram

Now that we've defined the proof class, we can use it in a `ZkProgram`.

:::warning
Pay attention to the constraints on the verification key.  Without these, _any_ valid proof can be sideloaded.
We want the flexibility of sideloading, but we need to be mindlful of the security implications!

```ts file=../snippets/sideloaded-vks/sideloaded-vks.ts start=start_multi_hash_program end=end_multi_hash_program
```

### Instantiation and Verifying the Wrap Proof

Finally, here is how you can instantiate a sideloaded proof and pass it as a parameter to the wrap
program.

```ts file=../snippets/sideloaded-vks/sideloaded-vks.ts start=start_multi_hash_verify end=end_multi_hash_verify
```
