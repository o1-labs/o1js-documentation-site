title: Sideloaded Verification Keys
sidebar_label: Sideloading
---

In the article on [recursion](/docs/advanced-concepts/recursion.mdx), we showed how o1js can be used to
write constraint systems that verify other constraint systems.  Those examples always assumed that the
prover has compiled an instance of the other `ZkProgram`.  We can, in fact, go even more general than that.
With sideloading, we can verify any proof, given that its shape (public inputs and outputs) are known at
compile time, and the verification key is available at runtime.

## Multiple Hash Example

Let's say we have an application with multiple hashing algorithms in use.  We want to write a simple Zk
Program to verify that a user knows the preimage of a hash, but we want to support any of our 
algorithms.  Let's solve this by writing a specific program for each algorithm, and a wrapper program
that verifies any of them.

```ts file=../snippets/sideloaded-vks/sideloaded-vks.ts start=start_multi_hash end=end_multi_hash
```
