title: Analyzing Constraint Systems
---

Optimizing o1js code is often not a matter of copying over optimized functions from VMs that operate over bytes, but instead 
a matter of minimizing the number of constraints required to model the code.  It's important to analyze the functions you write
to understand the constraint system that they generate.  o1js provides the tools toy need to understand how many, and what
types of constraints your program generates.

## Common Issues

### 0 Constraints

### Bitwise Operations Are Expensive

### Constraint Limit Exceeded
