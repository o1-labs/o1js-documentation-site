Optimizing o1js code is often not a matter of copying over optimized functions traditional programming languages, but instead 
a matter of minimizing the number of constraints required to model the code.  It's important to analyze the functions you write
to understand the constraint system that they generate.  o1js provides the tools you need to understand how many, and what
types of constraints your program generates.

#### Example provable function

For the following examples, let's define a dummy function that we can reuse in different contexts:

```ts file=../snippets/constraint-system/constraint-system.ts start=start_example_provable_function end=end_example_provable_function
```

## Using Provable.constraintSystem

`Provable.constraintSystem` is a way to create something like a "snippet" of provable code.  o1js can convert the snippet into a
constraint system, which can then be analyzed.  This simple wrapper is the lightest-weight way to quickly analyze some provable
code.  You can also use it to analyze specific pieces of a larger program, or specific functions.

:::note
This will not check correctness of the code.  It will only convert the code into a constraint system, which is essentially a list of steps to execute.
It will not execute the steps, or provide any guarantees that the constraint system generated is correct or secure.
:::

```ts file=../snippets/constraint-system/constraint-system.ts start=start_constraint_system_example end=end_constraint_system_example
```

The summary looks like this:

<CodeBlock language="json">
{JSON.stringify(constants.csSummary, null, 2)}
</CodeBlock>

## Using ZkProgram

`ZkProgram` is a more complete provable implementation of a program.  It has proper inputs and outputs, and methods that can be called to
create a proof.  The `ZkProgram` itself can be analyzed, which is a handy shortcut to simply get the analysis output for each method in
the program.  `ZkProgram` has type requirements and more configuration required than `Provable.constraintSystem`, so to check just some
pieces of code, `Provable.constraintSystem` is the better choice, but to analyze your methods in the context of a full program that's subject
to specific return types, inputs, and outputs, `ZkProgram` is the better choice.

:::info
`ZkProgram.analyzeMethods` uses `Provable.constraintSystem` under the hood, so ultimately, they expose the same functionality.
The main difference is the ergonomics of the API.  `Provable.constraintSystem` is a pure constraint system generation tool, while
`ZkProgram` is a more complete provable implementation, of which constraint system generation is one part.
:::

```ts file=../snippets/constraint-system/constraint-system.ts start=start_zk_program_example end=end_zk_program_example
```

Note how the same function results in the same constraint system summary:

<CodeBlock language="json">
{JSON.stringify(constants.zkpSummary, null, 2)}
</CodeBlock>

## Using SmartContract

`SmartContract` is a specialized class for writing proofs that interact with the Mina blockchain.  For the purposes of analyzing the
constraint system, it works like `ZkProgram`.  Keep in mind, that not every method on the `SmartContract` actually has to be
provable!  Non-provable methods will not be converted into constraint systems.  As a `class`, `SmartContracts` are just a JavaScript
object, so you can add any methods you want, just like any class.  Only methods decorated with `@method` will be marked as provable,
and included in the resulting constraint system.

:::info
`SmartContract.analyzeMethods` uses `Provable.constraintSystem` under the hood, so ultimately, they expose the same functionality.
Just like `ZkProgram`, `SmartContract` is a complete provable implementation of a program, but it layers on even more extra 
functionality in the form of compatibility with the Mina blockchain.

So `Provable.constraintSystem` is strictly a constraint system generation tool.  It's extremely generic and can't be used to create
a proof.  `ZkProgram` is a complete provable program, incvluding constraint system generation, but also proof generation and
verification.  `SmartContract` is a specialized wrapper around `ZkProgram` that is designed to work with the Mina blockchain.  All
of these tools can expose generated constraint system analyses.
