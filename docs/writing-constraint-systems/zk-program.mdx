title: Full Proof Flow with ZkProgram

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

`ZkProgram` is the culmination of all the provable types, functions and constraint system tools in o1js.  This is the
building block that let's you actually prove and verify execution of specific code.  You can see the api reference
for full type information, but two features that the `ZkProgram` gives you are access to the methods you define on
the system which generate a proof, and access to the `verify` method that clients can use to verify the proof.

## Simple ZkProgram Example

Every `ZkProgram` has a name, and a set of public input and output types.  These types are shared for every method in 
the system, so they can all generate the same kind of proof.

Methods in the `ZkProgram` can have custom _private_ inputs and outputs.  Private inputs are where the magic happens.
These allow you to pass in private data that you don't want to share with the verifier, and use it in the proof.
Private output is  more often used as a developer utility.  It is not available to the verifier, but it does provide 
a return value to the prover.  This can be used for debugging, or tracking some metadata that's not available in the
public output.

## ZkProgram with complex types

Most real world use cases for `ZkProgram` will involve complex data structures.  This is where you see the tangible
benefit of the o1js provable type APIs.  You can use any provable type as input into a `ZkProgram`, so with tools like
[Struct](/docs/basic-types/structs.mdx), and [IndexedMerkleMap](/docs/basic-types/merkle-trees.mdx#indexedmerklemap),
you can model realistic data structures and easily use them as inputs in your proofs.
